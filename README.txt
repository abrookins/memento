INTRODUCTION

This is a mostly non-functioning work-in-progress web app written to experiment
with CoffeeScript and node.js (with the Zappa framework). It allows the user to
view dated GeoRSS feed items on a map.

The front-end, located in public/js/map.coffee, uses Backbone.js to organize
logic between models, views, and controllers.
