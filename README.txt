WHAT IS THIS?

Memento is an attempt to create a simple, easy-to-use and fun to
develop web app sharing location-based memories. In effect, I wanted
more features from Google's "My Places" app, so I decided to create
my own.

Technically, the app is a nodejs weekend-project-style hodgepodge
written in CoffeeScript and some pure JS for the front-end, using
Mongo as the persistence layer (with the Mongoose library), and the
Zappa web framework.

The app is not packaged for deployment and is at present untested
- I'm just moseying along with it.
